# Bio_Juggernaut

-> Bio-Juggernaut is a social media app which allows users to report any unusual event in their eco-system. 
Ex: Improper Garbage Disposal or Dumping, Leaky electric lines or drains, Potholes, etc.

-> Users can file a report within a timespan of 20s which can make a world of difference as the app aims at delivering the report to the concerned authorities. 

-> The same report is also available on the app for other citizens (individual or part of any campaign or awareness program or NGOs) who can volunteer to fix the problem within their area of expertise. 

-> Get the app - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KkZVyfxQxfy7PyA4wkXx0Pf2vaJE4I-F?usp=sharing
